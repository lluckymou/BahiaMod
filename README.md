# BahiaMod
*BahiaMod is a tModLoader (Terraria) mod. It was initially developed in the span of 30 hours between 2020-06-9 and 2020-06-12 to add more content to the [Summoner](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide:Class_setups) class, considered by many as "incomplete".
This mod also adds the possibility to alter time and weather with (what I personally consider fair) items.*


Have you always wanted a true summoner NPC? What about a lady that truly cares about your progression as you become more powerful?
What about controlling time and weather? With the teachings of the Baiana NPC, you'll be able to do all of that while being a great summoner.

## [Wiki/Tutorial](https://github.com/lluckymou/BahiaMod/wiki)

## Trivia
Bahia is the fourth most populous state of Brazil. As a historical sugarcane hub and first capital of the country, the state became a hub for the Atlantic slave trade, bringing many people of African descent to the country.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahia): "...more than a third of all slaves taken from Africa were sent to Brazil, mostly to be processed in Bahia before being sent to work in plantations elsewhere in the country."


As a Brazilian myself I often see how many people portray Bahia's unique Afro-Brazilian culture as "tribal" or even "satanic".
With this mod, I want to celebrate the resilience of the Baianos holding to their way of life, and maybe sparking the curiosity of those curious enough to read through this text to research their culture as well.
Since I'm not from the State of Bahia (just an admirer) research was made in order not to offend anyone.

## Disclaimer
This mod has no intention to offend anyone. Research was made before its development and if you are Baiano and have any suggestions for the mod I'm completely open to hear them.

Salve o Ax√©! Viva a Bahia!
